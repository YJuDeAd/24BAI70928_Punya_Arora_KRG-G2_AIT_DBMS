## AIM: 
To design and implement PL/SQL programs utilizing conditional control statements such as IF–ELSE, ELSIF, ELSIF ladder, and CASE constructs in order to control the flow of execution based on logical conditions and to analyze decision-making capabilities in PL/SQL blocks.

## Software Requirements
- Database Management System:
    - PostgreSQL
- Database Administration Tool:
    - pgAdmin

## Objective:
-  Implement control structures in PL/SQL (IF-ELSE, ELSE-IF, ELSE-IF LADDER, CASE STATEMENTS in PL-SQL BLOCK)

## Problem Statement:
Develop and execute PL/SQL programs that demonstrate the use of conditional control statements. The programs should employ IF–ELSE, ELSIF, ELSIF ladder, and CASE statements to evaluate given conditions and control the flow of execution accordingly, thereby illustrating decision-making capabilities in PL/SQL blocks.

1. **Problem Statement – IF–ELSE Statement:**
Write a PL/SQL program to check whether a given number is positive or non-positive using the IF–ELSE conditional control statement and display an appropriate message.
2.  **Problem Statement – IF–ELSIF–ELSE Statement:**
Write a PL/SQL program to evaluate the grade of a student based on the obtained marks using the IF–ELSIF–ELSE statement and display the corresponding grade.
3. **Problem Statement – ELSIF Ladder:**
Write a PL/SQL program to determine the performance status of a student based on marks using an ELSIF ladder and display the appropriate result.
4. **Problem Statement – CASE Statement:**
Write a PL/SQL program to display the name of the day based on a given day number using the CASE conditional statement.
